## Introduction

The Adaline algorithm is a simple machine learning algorithm used for binary classification. It adjusts its weights and bias to minimize the squared error between the predicted and actual outputs. This implementation demonstrates how to train an Adaline model and visualize its decision boundary.

The Perceptron is one of the simplest machine learning algorithms used for binary classification. It aims to find a linear decision boundary that can separate two classes of data points. The algorithm learns by adjusting its weights and bias during training to correctly classify data points.

## Dependencies

This implementation requires the following dependencies:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)

You can install these dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
