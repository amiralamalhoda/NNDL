Here you can find the Python implementation of some of the classical memory neural networks described in the book "Fundamentals of neural networks" by Fausett.

following networks are implemented:

- Hebb memory net
- Iterative auto-associative net
- Discrete Hopfield net
- Bidirectional associative net
