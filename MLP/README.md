# Multi Layer Perceptron

Using Multi layer perceptron neural nets to classify the fashion mnist dataset. experimenting with different model sizes and training batch sizes.

# dimensionality reduction

Using dimensionality reduction techniques to boost the accuracy of classification of MLPs on the fashion mnist dataset. reduction techniques used are:

- Autoencoder neural net
- Principal component analysis (PCA)
- Cascaded RBM
